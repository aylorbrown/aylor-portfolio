            <div class="about">
                <p>I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in art and design. 
                Like many Millenials, I grew up with unfettered access to the internet. 
                I ran free on the web - discovering a new creative outlet and beginning a 
                lifelong passion for making things. Customizing Livejournal themes with HTML 
                turned into studying Fiber and Material Studies at the School of the Art 
                Institute.
                <br>
                <br>
                At art school, a Digital Jacquard Weaving professor taught the 
                relationship between woven textiles and programming. Ada Lovelace, the 
                first computer programmer, took inspiration from the Jacquard loom to develop 
                a theoretical all-purpose computer with Charles Babbage. Ada Lovelace became a 
                hero of mine. She pursued her interest in mathmetics even though it was unheard 
                of for a woman of her time. She had insight and realized that Babbage's machine 
                was capable of much more than its original purpose of numerical calculations. 
                I made a promise to myself to pursue programming later in life.
                <br>
                <br>
                After a decade working in textiles, retail and e-commerce, I now help 
                companies build the web. When I'm not in front of a screen, 
                you can find me hiking upstate with my Carolina Dog, Dexter, dancing to Megan thee
                Stallion, cooking Korean food, or reading Jane Jacobs.
                <br>

                Want to work together? I'd love to hear from you.
