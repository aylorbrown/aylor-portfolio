        <p class="project-text">I am currently building a full-stack pelvic floor exercise app in React Native. Inspired by my own frustrations with physical therapy options after a pelvic fracture, ROOT has features and a user experience that center developing a strong pelvic floor for the sole purpose of enhancing a woman's quality of life. There are several different exercises options including kegels, diaphramatic breathing, and deep squats.
        Note: The above repo and demo gif is a sketch built in React.

        Independent project built with React Native. Responsible for all design and development from wireframe to assets and site build.</p>
